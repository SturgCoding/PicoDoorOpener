CAD files (STL) for door handle will be added once fixed and working on my one at home

- DO DO:
    Add STL
    Develop a universal solution to handle pulling

    Figure out what type of motor/servo will be best for overcoming the force of the handle pull
    and add code to allow the script handler to enable the operation of the handle

- TO IMPROVE:
    Captive Portal aspect or BLE communication to allow for faster or 'auto' access
    to the portal/interface
